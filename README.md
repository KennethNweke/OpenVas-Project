# OpenVas Project
Vulnerability Assessment

## Objective
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) on a network with the IP range of 192.168.244.0/24. The goal was to identify potential security weaknesses across various systems and applications to enhance the overall security posture of the network.
